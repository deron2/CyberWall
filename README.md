# CyberWall
A wall that is cyber
## Introduction
Lennon walls first appeared in 2014 during the democracy protests. Their first appearance was along the staircase outside of the Government Offices. Hong Kongers posted colorful post-it notes wishing for democracy, allowing them to express their opinions in a polite, effective manner anonymously.
During the 2019 anti-extradition bill protests, Lennon Walls appeared all over Hong Kong again. Based on a crowd-sourced map, 150 Lennon walls appeared during the demonstrations.
Following on July 10th of 2019, the Hong Kong Police started removing Lennon Walls and suppressing the creation of new ones. There have been reported physical attacks on people just by watching and reading the Lennon Wall.  
We are introducing the CyberWall is an Augmented Reality Experience, which will enable the user to experience a virtual Lennon Wall which can be placed in the real world. By looking through their smartphone, they can see the CyberWall in the real world.
By moving the Lennon Wall into the cyberspace, people will be safe expressing their views and opinions on the movement. Furthermore, it will be more challenging for the government to put it down. It will be the face behind the mask that the government tries to put up.
## Realization
The application is built for Apple iPhones or iPad by using their Augmented Reality framework ARKit in Unity through the ArFoundation SDK.
When the application is started, the user is asked to scan the environment. After a large enough space to place the CyberWall has been detected, the app will display the wall and load social media messages and display them in a post-it-note design to resemble the Lennon wall. The notes will be color-coded (e.g., hashtag, location, source of social network). Newer post-it notes will be placed on top of older ones.
